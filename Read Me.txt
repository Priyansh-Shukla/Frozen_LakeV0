Just run the fule vi_and_pi.py.

It will automatically show the graphs for 1st the deterministic P.I, then V.I., then stochastic P.I. and V.I. (in that order).
Close the graph Window that pops up every time for the next set of calculations to run.

The value for gamma function and tollerance can be changed in the function call inside __main__
